# About Me

My name is Gracie Maulik, and I am a senior Economics-Mathematics major with a minor in Data Science at Whitman College. I am a data-driven individual who is passionate about problem-solving and helping others. I am interested in exploring many career paths, with interests in sports, finance, and data science. Below are links to my LinkedIn profile, as well as some projects I have completed while at Whitman.

### Where's Schueller?

Below is an embedded plot of where Schueller was on May 31st, 2024.

### Data Sources and Project Ideas

#### 1.) Basketball Data

> Data: [Basketball Reference](https://www.basketball-reference.com/wnba/teams/)

> This website has data from the NBA and WNBA on all players and teams including individual game statistics and team statistics. It would be fascinating to look at different player's average statistics (points per game, rebounds per game, etc.) and compare that to how the team has performed. It would also just be cool to convert the data into a time series and plot a player's performance over time. One other idea that Carly had was to visualize the areas on the court where players have made the most shots and determine their optimal shooting location.

#### 2.) UN Environmental Data

> Data: [UN Environmental Data (under the Environment Tab)](https://data.un.org)

> The environmental datasets look at CO2 emissions, threatened species, and water supply/sanitation coverage per country. Using this data, it would be cool to explore each country's numbers and compare them to economic indicators over time, such as GDP per capita. This potentially would show the overall health of the country and it would be interesting to see if the environmental and economic parts of the country are related. 

#### 3.) Census Data

> Data: [United States Census Database](https://data.census.gov/)

> This database has all of the census data from the United States, including demographic information and population counts. I think it would be interesting to compare different indicators with each other, such as population over time and poverty over time. The data could be resampled to have the same time series and could be plotted on the same graph to see if there were any visible relationships. 

#### 4.) Economic Indicators Data

> Data: [World Bank Economic Indicators](https://databank.worldbank.org/)

> The database above has loads of data on all countries across the world on everything from GDP per capita to mortality rates. It is an overwhelmingly large dataset, but one that could be used to compare to other datasets addressed above. US GDP per capita over the years can be tied in with census data or human poverty levels per country can be compared to the CO2 emissions that a country produces. 

#### 5.) Presidential Data and the Bureau of Labor Statistics

> Data: [Bureau of Labor Statistics](https://data.bls.gov/dataQuery/search)

> This dataset contains US data on the unemployment rate and job growth. It would be fascinating to take the years of each presidential administration and compare each presidencies unemployment rate and job growth. It is always an issue that Republicans cite as their main factor for voting, it would be interesting to see if Republican presidents have done more for the economy than Democrats or vice verse.
